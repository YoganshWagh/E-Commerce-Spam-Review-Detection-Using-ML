Review
more comfort and unique in colour
"In terms of quality the product is good, it is stylish, and comfortable, good for winter season. But if you have foot size 28 cm then buy 8 number shoe... I hope this will be helpful."
Nice fit and good quality shoes
The shoe has cool comfort from inside. Good to use strong from outside. Mostly I like the comfort I'll buy one more.
"Usage:Worn for tough, everyday activities.Likes:Attractive design, particularly at a discounted price during a sale. Perceived durability. Rubber sole layer reduces skidding.Dislikes:Heavier than expected, despite being labeled as lightweight.Conclusion:These sneakers offer style and durability, especially with the added rubber sole layer for improved traction. However, they may not meet expectations for lightweight wear. Overall, a solid option for rugged use."
Built quality good but inner side material is hard and painful for foot
"Its a steal deal @1100 ðŸ’¥...Best in comfort, look & style..Go for it.."
Not smooth as premium products like Nike and Addidas but overall feel and looks well. And value for money
Itâ€™s original and good quality but it is little bit heavy
